# Flappy Covid

> Flappy Covid is a Flappy Bird clone made in P5.js. The rules are simple. The objective is to direct a flying corona virus, who moves continuously to the right, between sets of pipes of soap. If the player touches the soap, they lose. If the screen is not tapped, the virus falls because of gravity; each pair of pipes that it navigates between earns the player a single point. On mobile you can tap and on desktop you click the left mouse button to jump.
